Project Name: MyStore TagLine: Showcasing basic Angular usage through a dynamic web-store platform.

2. Team Members
Team:
Nkrumah Dubazana - Frontend Developer: He will handle all the AngularJS development and styling because of his expertise in JavaScript and previous experience with Angular projects.
Tega Onosakponome - Backend Developer: He will also manage the backend services including database management and server-side logic. With a strong background in Node.js and database systems like PostgreSQL it makes him an ideal candidate for this role.


4. Technologies
Technologies Used:
AngularJS
Node.js
PostgreSQL
npm
GitHub
Heroku for deployment
Technology Choices:
AngularJS vs ReactJS: AngularJS was chosen for its comprehensive solution that includes built-in services such as HTTP requests and its strong two-way data binding, which is beneficial for dynamic applications like an online store. ReactJS was considered for its virtual DOM features, but AngularJS was selected for its full-fledged framework capabilities, reducing the need for additional libraries.
PostgreSQL vs MySQL: PostgreSQL is used due to its robustness, scalability, and strong community support, especially useful for handling complex queries and vast amounts of data, which is expected for a web-store. MySQL was another option due to its popularity and ease of use, but PostgreSQL was preferred for its advanced features.


5. Challenge Statement
Challenge:
The project aims to solve the problem of providing a seamless online shopping experience with a fully functional web store that includes features like product browsing, user authentication, and order management.
What the Portfolio Project will not solve: It will not handle supply chain management or integrate with physical store inventory systems.
Users: The primary users will be end consumers looking for a convenient shopping experience online. Secondary users include store admins who need tools to manage the store's products and orders.
Locale Dependence: The project is not specifically tied to any locale but can be adapted for use in different regions with appropriate localization adjustments.


7. Risks
Technical Risks:
Dependency management issues might arise with numerous npm packages. Using Docker can mitigate environment discrepancies.
Potential security vulnerabilities in user data handling. Implementing robust security protocols and regular code audits will serve as safeguards.
Non-Technical Risks:
Market competition with more established e-commerce platforms. Unique selling propositions and effective marketing strategies will be crucial.


9. Infrastructure
Branching/Merging: GitHub Flow will be adopted to ensure a smooth development process, with separate branches for features and a strict code review process before merging.
Deployment Strategy: Continuous deployment will be handled through Heroku, enabling automatic updates to the live environment upon new commits to the master branch.
Data Population: Initial product data will be loaded from a provided JSON file, with future plans to integrate an admin panel for dynamic data entry.
Testing: Automated testing will be conducted using tools like Jasmine for unit tests and Protractor for end-to-end testing.
10. Existing Solutions
Similar Products: Amazon, eBay, and other large-scale e-commerce platforms.
Differences: MyStore focuses on demonstrating technology through a simple, yet fully functional, online store platform, unlike comprehensive commercial solutions which offer a wide array of additional services like warehouse and shipping management.
Reimplementing Solutions: For example, choosing AngularJS over other frameworks due to its suitability for dynamic single-page applications which are common in e-commerce scenarios.
